# Deployment Guide Retired

This page has been retired. The platform now deploys exclusively to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Istio/Envoy filters and Azure managed services (PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Azure Cache for Redis, Key Vault via CSI, Azure Monitor, and Azure Front Door/Application Gateway).

Please use the canonical guide: [Azure AKS Deployment](azure.md).
